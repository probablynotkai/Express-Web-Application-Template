## Express Web Application Template
This is a simple template for Express Web Applications which I personally use. It is very important to ensure that you have installed all of the correct prerequisites with NodeJS before running this application, otherwise you will get errors regarding missing modules.

## Prerequisites
```
npm install express --save
npm install body-parser --save
npm instal cors --save
```
